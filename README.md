# Overview

EmulateIE is a Movable Type plugin that instructs the more recent versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to properly display Movable Type CMS pages by placing the browser into 'IE7 Standards Mode' for Movable Type 4.x and 'IE8 Standards Mode' for Movable Type 5.x.

This plugin resolves a problem with Internet Explorer's display of the "Rich Text Editor" in all versions of Movable Type 4.x and some versions of Movable Type 5.x.
